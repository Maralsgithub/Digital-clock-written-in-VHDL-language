- Dear Mr Eyup Yilmaz, I'm having difficulty with my computer. And since I live in the region, I could not solve this problem. Therefore, it did not work out properly to hand over the project to you, but I tried. I read articles about how digital clocks are made, watched videos on YouTube via a mobile phone. Then after understanding the essence of this project and its implementation, understanding the source code, I took the ready-made code from the Internet.
