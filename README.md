# Digital-clock-written-in-VHDL-language
- **Final Project of second semester on digital electronics**

- Student is **Maral kenzhebek kyzy** COM-19 of Ala-too University, computer science department

- **Dear Mr Eyup Yilmaz**, I'm having difficulty with my computer. And since I live in the region, I could not solve this problem. Therefore, it did not work out properly to hand over the project to you(.sof file, sreenshot), but I tried. I read articles about how digital clocks are made, watched videos on YouTube via a mobile phone. Then after understanding the essence of this project and its implementation, understanding the source code, I took the ready-made code from the Internet.

- **Description :  VHDL code for digital clock on FPGA**
This project is the **Digital clock with hour, minutes and seconds.** Built **on FPGA platform with VHDL** hardware description language**

This digital clock is a reconfigurable 24-hour clock displaying hours, minutes, and seconds on seven-segment LEDs . Besides, users can manually set the time of the digital clock including hours and minutes through switches.
